# Red, Green, Refactor Model Build

Create a Car model using the red, green, refactor approach.

## Car Model

A car has an id, make, model, and year properties.

You should be able to:

* `insert` a car
* `findById` a car
* `find` all cars
* `update` a car by id
* `delete` a car by id

## Commits

You will only get points if you have the following commit history:

* Commit when you write a failing test
* Commit when your test passes
* Commit if/when you refactor
